# Image-classifier-SVHN-dataset
Image classifier for the SVHN dataset

- We will use the [SVHN dataset](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/). This is an image dataset of over 600,000 digit images in all, and is a harder dataset than MNIST as the numbers appear in the context of natural scene images. SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images.

- We will create a neural network that classifies real-world images digits
